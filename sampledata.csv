Science,When a cell divides  one of its main jobs is to make sure that each of the two new cells gets a full  perfect copy of genetic material. Mistakes during copying  or unequal division of the genetic material between cells  can lead to cells that are unhealthy or dysfunctional (and may lead to diseases such as cancer).
Science,In a cell  DNA does not usually exist by itself  but instead associates with specialized proteins that organize it and give it structure. In eukaryotes  these proteins include the histones  a group of basic (positively charged) proteins that form “bobbins” around which negatively charged DNA can wrap. In addition to organizing DNA and making it more compact  histones play an important role in determining which genes are active. The complex of DNA plus histones and other structural proteins is called chromatin.
Math,The coordinate plane is divided into four quadrants. Quadrant one (QI) is the top right fourth of the coordinate plane  where there are only positive coordinates. Quadrant two (QII) is the top left fourth of the coordinate plane. Quadrant three (QIII) is the bottom left fourth. Quadrant four (QIV) is the bottom right fourth.
Math,You are graphing quadrilateral ABCDABCDA  B  C  D in the coordinate plane. The length of segment ABABA  B is the same as the length of segment DCDCD  C  and both segments are horizontal. The following are three vertices of the quadrilateral: A(1 1)A(1 1)A  left parenthesis  1  comma  1  right parenthesis  C(4.5 4)C(4.5 4)C  left parenthesis  4  point  5  comma  4  right parenthesis  and D(-1.5 4)D(−1.5 4)D  left parenthesis  minus  1  point  5  comma  4  right parenthesis. All you know about point BBB is that it is in the first quadrant.
Social Studies,By roughly 6000 to 8000 years ago  agriculture was well under way in several regions including Ancient Egypt  around the Nile River; the Indus Valley civilization; Mesopotamia  between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers; and Ancient China  along the Yellow and Yangtze rivers. This is because the regular river floods made for fertile soil around the banks and the rivers could also supply fresh water to irrigate crops. It’s no coincidence that as agriculture allowed for denser and denser populations along with more specialized societies  some of the world’s first civilizations developed in these areas as well.
Social Studies,Associated with Mesopotamia are ancient cultures like the Sumerians  Assyrians  Akkadians  and Babylonians. Learning about this time period can be a little confusing because these cultures interacted with and ruled over each other over the course of several thousand years. These terms can also be associated with city-states  languages  religions  or empires—depending on the time and context we are looking at.

Math,Problem 1 explains the location of the primary rainbow  but how do we explain the colors? Sunlight comprises a range of wavelengths  from the red range through orange  yellow  green  blue  indigo  and violet. As Newton discovered in his prism experiments of 1666  the index of refraction is different for each color. (The effect is called dispersion.) For red light the refractive index is k 􏰩 1.3318 whereas for violet light it is k 􏰩 1.3435. By repeating the calculation of Problem 1 for these values of k  show that the rainbow angle is about 42.3􏰉 for the red bow and 40.6􏰉 for the violet bow. So the rainbow really consists of seven individual bows corresponding to the seven colors.
Math,Perhaps you have seen a fainter secondary rainbow above the primary bow. That results from the part of a ray that enters a raindrop and is refracted at A  reflected twice (at B and C)  and refracted as it leaves the drop at D (see the figure at the left). This time the deviation angle D􏰤 􏰥 is the total amount of counterclockwise rotation that the ray undergoes in this four- stage process.
Math,We start with a fact  known as the Mean Value Theorem  that will be useful not only for present purposes but also for explaining why some of the other basic results of calculus are true.
Math,Since f 􏰂􏰤c􏰥 is the slope of the tangent line at the point 􏰤c  f 􏰤c􏰥􏰥  the Mean Value Theorem  in the form given by Equa- tion 1  says that there is at least one point P􏰤c  f 􏰤c􏰥􏰥 on the graph where the slope of the tangent line is the same as the slope of the secant line AB. In other words  there is a point P where the tangent line is parallel to the secant line AB. It seems clear that there is one such point P in Figure 1 and two such points P1 and P2 in Figure 2. Because our intuition tells us that the Mean Value Theorem is true  we take it as the starting point for the devel- opment of the main facts of calculus. (When calculus is developed from first principles  however  the Mean Value Theorem is proved as a consequence of the axioms that define the real number system.)
Math,Notice in Figure 5 that the slopes of the tangent lines increase from left to right on the interval 􏰤a  b􏰥  so f 􏰂 is increasing and f is concave upward (abbreviated CU) on 􏰤a  b􏰥. [It can be proved that this is equivalent to saying that the graph of f lies above all of its tangent lines on 􏰤a  b􏰥.] Similarly  the slopes of the tangent lines decrease from left to right on 􏰤b  c􏰥  so f 􏰂 is decreasing and f is concave downward (CD) on 􏰤b  c􏰥.
Math,In view of the Concavity Test  there is a point of inflection at any point where the sec- ond derivative changes sign. A consequence of the Concavity Test is the following test for maximum and minimum values.
Math,Our final example is concerned with families of functions. This means that the functions in the family are related to each other by a formula that contains one or more arbitrary con- stants. Each value of the constant gives rise to a member of the family and the idea is to see how the graph of the function changes as the constant changes.
Math,The method we used to sketch curves in the preceding section was a culmination of much of our study of differential calculus. The graph was the final object that we produced. In this section our point of view is completely different. Here we start with a graph produced by a graphing calculator or computer and then we refine it. We use calculus to make sure that we reveal all the important aspects of the curve. And with the use of graphing devices we can tackle curves that would be far too complicated to consider without technology. The theme is the interaction between calculus and calculators.

Math,"Now let’s consider marketing. Let p􏰤x􏰥 be the price per unit that the company can charge if it sells x units. Then p is called the demand function (or price function) and we would expect it to be a decreasing function of x. If x units are sold and the price per unit is p􏰤x􏰥, then the total revenue is"

Social Studies,"The Southwest region, expanding through present-day Arizona and New Mexico and into Colorado, Texas, Utah, and Mexico, was home to a variety of indigenous groups and cultural practices pre-colonization. In this region dwelled several groups we collectively call the Pueblo. The Spanish first gave them this name, which means “town” or “village,” because they lived in towns or villages of permanent stone-and-mud buildings with thatched roofs. The three main groups of the Pueblo people were the Mogollon, Hohokam, and Anasazi."
Social Studies,"Soon thereafter, European Christians began the Crusades, a campaign of violence against Muslims to dominate the Holy Lands—an area that extended from modern-day Turkey in the north along the Mediterranean coast to the Sinai Peninsula—under Islamic control, partially in response to sustained Muslim control in Europe. The city of Jerusalem is a holy site for Jews, Christians, and Muslims; evidence exists that the three religions lived there in harmony for centuries. But in 1095, European Christians decided not only to reclaim the holy city from Muslim rulers but also to conquer the entire surrounding area."
Social Studies,"Popé, a Pueblo leader and medicine man led a response to the persecution and violence—a return to native customs. He popularized the idea that “when Jesus came, the Corn Mothers went away.” This was a succinct way of describing the displacement of native traditions by the culture and religion of the Spanish."
Social Studies,How did the Pueblo uprising contribute to the formation of a new ethnic identity in the Southwest?
Social Studies,"For African Americans in the South, life after slavery was a world transformed. Gone were the brutalities and indignities of slave life, the whippings and sexual assaults, the selling and forcible relocation of family members, the denial of education, wages, legal marriage, homeownership, and more. African Americans celebrated their newfound freedom both privately and in public jubilees."
Social Studies,"African Americans’ desire for education found expression in the establishment of schools at every level, from grade schools for basic-education to the founding of the nation’s first black colleges such as Fisk University and Howard University. The Freedmen’s Bureau (1865-1870), a government agency established to aid former slaves, oversaw some 3,000 schools across the South, and ran hospitals and healthcare facilities for the freedmen."
Social Studies,"During the period of Reconstruction, which lasted from 1865 to 1877, Congress passed and enforced laws that promoted civil and political rights for African Americans across the South. Most notable among the laws Congress passed were three Amendments to the US Constitution: the Thirteenth Amendment (1865) ended slavery, the Fourteenth Amendment (1868) guaranteed African Americans the rights of American citizenship, and the Fifteenth Amendment (1870) guaranteed black men the constitutional right to vote."
