# BookAssist

## Inspiration
With the transition back to in-person learning around the corner, we found that there was a large need for an application that allowed students to clarify subjects and problems that they had trouble with that they could not target when learning online.
## What it does
BookAssist allows students to scan textbooks and select problems and topics that they need clarification on. They can then send them to instructors who receive a cohesive class report of problems that need to be focused on which can be targeted in classes
## How we built it
We used Flutter, an SDK developed by Flutter, to create an interactive mobile application. 
## Challenges we ran into
We ran into multiple challenges with firebase backend integration into our mobile flutter application. 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of debugging our application and creating simple UI that has fast connections to our backend databases in firebase.
## What we learned
We learned a lot about firebase backend and the realtime database as well as Flutter and dart to create our app.
## What's next for Book Assist
We hope to expand into multiple other areas of learning as well as create a desktop application to allow teachers to manage students with more powerful tools.
